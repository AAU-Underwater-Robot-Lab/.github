# AAU Underwater Technology Group

The **Underwater Technology Group** at AAU Energy, Aalborg University develops advanced systems for subsea robotics, sensing, and autonomy. We support inspection, monitoring, and intervention tasks in challenging underwater environments through applied research and open-source tool development.

## Focus areas
- Autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles (AUVs/ROVs)
- Subsea perception using sonar, vision, and hyperspectral sensors
- Synthetic dataset generation and AI-based segmentation
- Hydrodynamic modeling and vehicle control
- ROS2-based integration, simulation, and deployment

## Public repositories
We maintain and publish selected repositories covering:
- Dataset catalogs and segmentation tools
- ROS2 drivers and control stacks for underwater sensors and vehicles
- Simulators and BlueROV2 integration modules
- Supporting tools for development and evaluation
